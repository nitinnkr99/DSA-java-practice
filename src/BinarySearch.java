            binary search algorithm is a faster way to find a element in a sorted array.
            Step-1 : In the given sorted array find the middle element.
            Step-2 : compare the key with middle element.
            Step-3 : If the key is smaller , element is in first half , search in left part.
            Step-4 : If the key is larger , element is in second half , search in right.
            Step-5 : Make the starting and ending point in the array where element is and again repeat from step-1.

              mid = (Start pt. + end pt.)/2
              best case = O(1)
              worst case = O(log n)
